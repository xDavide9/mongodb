after learning how to use mongodb in the shell locally it's important to consider the real world scenario:
the best way to use mongodb is to use it as a service, so you don't have to worry about the server, the backups, the security, the scaling...
you can use mongodb atlas, which is the official mongodb service which is free to use for small projects
and if you want to expand it you could run on aws, azure, or google cloud

to connect to your databases you could use a shell like mongosh, or gui clients like mongo-express, mongo compass or jetbrains' datagrip
